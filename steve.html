                <p>Steve Jobs' journey from a college dropout to one of the most influential figures in technology is a story of innovation, perseverance, and visionary thinking. His contributions to the tech world have left an indelible mark on modern society.</p>
                <p>Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Jobs was adopted by a loving family. He showed an early interest in electronics and eventually enrolled at Reed College. However, he dropped out after just one semester, seeking a different path in life.</p>
                <p>In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in his parents' garage. The introduction of the Apple I and later the Apple II revolutionized personal computing. However, his journey was not without challenges. In 1985, Jobs was ousted from Apple after a power struggle within the company.</p>
                <p>Undeterred, Jobs founded NeXT, a computer platform development company, and acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar's success with films like "Toy Story" showcased Jobs' ability to innovate across industries.</p>
                <p>In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company he had founded. Under his leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. These innovations transformed technology and consumer electronics, making Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world.</p>
                <p>Jobs' vision extended beyond just products. His focus on design, user experience, and brand loyalty set new standards in the industry. His famous speeches and presentations, particularly at Apple's keynotes, showcased his ability to inspire and captivate audiences.</p>
                <p>Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, but his legacy continues to inspire entrepreneurs and innovators worldwide. His belief in following one's passion and thinking differently serves as a guiding light for those looking to make their mark on the world.</p>
